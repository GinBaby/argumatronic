title: Why I'm Done with Twitter

> The world dies over and over again, but the skeleton always gets up and walks. -- Henry Miller

A while ago, I started an alternate account on Twitter. During the LambdaConf controversy, so much of what I tweeted was being interpreted as negatively as possible, and Twitter became quite a miserable place for me. My alternate account is tiny, less than 100 followers, mostly people I've known and talked to ever since I started Twitter.

Yesterday, I was doing some research for a blog post I've been thinking about regarding the ways that serious philosophy gets distorted as it becomes popularized. Outside of religion, the schools of philosophy I see this most with are utilitarianism, stoicism, Zen, and poststructuralism. It interests me to think about why each has become what it has in the popular discourse.

Now, some of you know I have a special interest in certain schools of online misogyny, and so I was reading some blog posts about how stoicism can get you laid more -- I believe this is meant for men only, sorry, ladies. I got quite irritated by this, as one does, and tweeted, from my small alt account, a snarky comment about how people who talk about stoicism and Zen all the time seem emotionally unstable to me. 

There was a short thread following, in which we agreed "immature" might be more accurate than "unstable." And I went on about my day.

It seems that someone interpreted my snarky tweet as not being about unspecified groups of online misogynists but being about one specific person. They told that person I was tweeting about them. Then I got angry DMs from that person about something that had nothing to do with them. I am not going to apologize for misinterpreted tweets on my small personal account, but the whole situation is indicative of why I don't want to use Twitter much anymore. 

I will have to keep my main account, argumatronic, active, in part because that's the account I use for experiments involving my super cool Twitter bot project and in part because there are a few people I'd not like to lose touch with. I'll keep DMs as a point of contact (they are not open, so you must be someone I follow in order to use them, I believe). But Twitter will likely never be the place it once was for me. It begins to consume a lot of time and energy, and I would prefer to put my energy into new projects.

And I do have new projects in mind, both solo and with some other folks, that I'm very excited about. It seems likely that I will be organizing a local "hands-on Haskell" meetup in Austin where we'll work through the book and work on projects together. I have a couple more books I have already started researching and outlining. 

But first, while I cannot speak for my co-author, I remain committed to releasing the final version of Haskell Programming soon and seeing it through to a print version. Furthermore, I remain committed to keeping it updated as GHC goes through inevitable changes so that it stays current and useful.

And some of you have emailed, very kindly, to ask if I am fine. I am fine, thank you. I have enough people around me who do know exactly what has happened and how much work I've put into Haskell Programming and learning programming from the ground up over the past couple of years, and I am quite OK with things as they are now. Me announcing the split with Chris publicly and quitting Twitter isn't because I'm *not* fine -- it's because I am fine, and I need to move on from the emotional toxicity of Twitter and forge ahead in the things I have planned for the future. 

Now, hopefully, we can get back to our regularly scheduled programming and the next post will be something happier and perhaps Haskellier. Cheers.
