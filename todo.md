add a "book reviews" link on the nav bar

add book reviews
should probably get a No Starch affiliate account going

book reviews will be of 3 types: adult, kids, kids math/sci/programming

with adult, put a "the 10 novels that made me" post (Borribles, Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles, The Plague, Angle of Repose, Solider of the Great War, )

with kids, include ones they like to read (whether school or otherwise) and also advice on teaching them reading

with kids math etc. include advice on getting them to like math etc

need to make the nav bar responsive so it goes up top on mobile (see teef)

i like the idea of adding tags and possibly also adding the opening sentences to the home page. there are blog post tutorials for such.
