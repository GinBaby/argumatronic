You're just asking me to listen to the same things I've been listening to my whole life instead of spending my time doing something I could learn from.

Oh this wasn't even just Damore this year. This also happened around Lambdaconf2017, yes? The TL full of rage that women wouldn't want to spend valuable time to listen to a motivational speech by a man who starts from the premise that women are less capable of reason than men.

And that it's inherently less inclusive to ask them to do so and to pay for that privilege, no less. But what could I, or any of us, possibly have to learn from a talk by someone who starts from a long-refuted premise? It's so boring, so old.

So I was told today that it's my right not to listen to people when they are telling me I must listen to a sexist. Yet it seems like that would entail not listening to a large chunk of the FP community (I cannot speak about other communities), and so it isn't really something I can afford to do.

I know that publishing this is giving more publicity to lambdaconf and the sexist keynote speaker. that's ok. i think men who need a safe space from considering women full and equal participants in society should have one (and stay away from me). i think it's a real shame that it seems to involve so much of the FP community
