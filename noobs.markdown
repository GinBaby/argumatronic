title: For Beginners
---

People ask me a lot how they can best get started with programming, functional programming, or Haskell specifically. Of course, I think [my book](http://haskellbook.com/), which was written for beginners, is a great place to start, but people have different needs. I'm going to try to collect here the things that I have personally found most helpful for getting started with programming and with Haskell. It's an opinionated collection. It might not be perfectly suited to your needs, but these are things that worked for me.

## What to do first

OK, you're here looking at a Haskell-ish blog already so maybe you don't need this advice. But. Just in case. 

This [Getting Started](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started) guide will help you get set up quickly. For more in depth instructions, as well as guides in foreign languages, try the [Learn Haskell repo](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) maintained by Chris Allen.

I do recommend you just get [Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) right off the bat and look through some of its documentation. The documentation for it is thorough and clear. Chris Allen and I also made a [video about using Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw). The video is long, but that's because we cover a bunch of weird edge cases that you may never encounter. There are time stamps in the information that you can click on to get what you need. 

If you are itching to see how a project is set up in Haskell, try Chris's [How I Start: Haskell](http://howistart.org/posts/haskell/1) article and enjoy processing some CSV data. 

## Books

When we're talking about learning resources, I am very opinionated. In the course of writing our Haskell book, I have read most of the other Haskell books. I recognize that not everyone's judgments here will be the same as mine, but these are what worked best for me (totally new programmer with not a lot of math background):  

  - [Haskell Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell): The wikibook is free, which is awesome, and it really starts from the basics and works its way up in a nice progression. It has some exercises, although you'll want more. You can get more exercises by doing [cis194], the [99 Problems in Haskell], and the [NICTA course], among other things. All of those are free. The wikibook does have uneven coverage -- some topics aren't covered enough and some parts are not as well written as others, which just follows from it being a wikibook. However, I found many parts of it very clear and reasonably easy to follow.
  - [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) by Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki: Sure. It's my book. This is how I learned Haskell, so it covers thoroughly all the things I didn't know, which was everything. It assumes no particular background knowledge besides some familiarity with high school level algebra. It goes from the lambda calculus through monad transformers, parser combinators, and exception handling, so it covers more than enough to get you working on your own projects in Haskell (or other functional languages). It has quite a few exercises.
  - [Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming](http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html) by Simon Thompson: Ah, this book is not free, and it's not perfect, but I do love this book. It has quite a few exercises, and I found them interesting and challenging without making me want to hurl the book through the window.
