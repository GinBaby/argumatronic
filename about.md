title: About
---

I have been a teacher, librarian, linguist, student of philosophy, and writer. I am still at least three of those things.

I cowrote [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/).

I am now writing [The Joy of Haskell](https://joyofhaskell.com/). 

I'm interested in helping people learn to create technology. I care a lot about making math and (mostly functional) programming accessible and approachable to all. I think a lot about human interactions and ethics and pedagogy. To that end, I'm producing books, blog posts, documentation, and open source pedagogical materials.
