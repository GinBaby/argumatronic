title: About
---

I have been a teacher, librarian, linguist, student of philosophy, and writer. I am still at least three of those things.

I cowrote Haskell Programming from First Principles. That is how I learned Haskell.

I am now writing [The Joy of Haskell](https://joyofhaskell.com/) and writing extensively at [Type Classes](https://typeclasses.com/). Both of these are concerns I founded with [Chris Martin](https://chris-martin.org/).

I'm interested in helping people learn to create technology. I care a lot about making math and (mostly functional) programming accessible and approachable to all. I think a lot about human interactions and ethics and pedagogy. To that end, I'm producing books, blog posts, documentation, and [open source pedagogical materials](https://github.com/Austin-Haskell).

## Talks

* [GHCi Helps Those Who Help Themselves](https://typeclasses.com/news/2018-10-ghci-helps-those) Invited workshop at LambdaWorld Seattle 2018. This workshop covers strategies for entering into friendly dialogue with GHCi to gain insight into your code. Sadly, this was not recorded.

* [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Metaphor](/posts/2018-09-02-effective-metaphor.mdown) Invited keynote at Compose :: Melbourne 2018. This keynote is all about metaphor and how metaphor gave birth to mathematics.

* At [Monadic Party](https://monadic.party/) I gave a six-hour workshop entitled *A Gentle Introduction to Profunctors* over the course of three days. You can view the videos. 
  * [Part One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfQdtPbYhV0) 
  * [Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtXqs9dNagk&list=PLcAu_kKy-krz3t2teYyCM0Lt4015DF-Zp&index=10&t=16s) 
  * [Part Three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCkTsO-QcNA)

* At ZuriHac 2018 I gave a six-hour workshop on beginner Haskell that was streamed live. You can view [part one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fNIhrDhaYA) and [part two here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=revYLeEHWVw). 

* [A Parliament of Functors](https://www.lambda-squared.com/schedule/session-4-5) Invited talk at LambdaSquared 2018. This mostly focused on contravariance and was turned into [an article for Type Classes](https://typeclasses.com/contravariance).

* [A Monoid for All Seasons](/posts/2017-10-12-haskellx17-talk.mdown) Keynote at Haskell eXchange 2017. This is a historical, beginner-friendly introduction to monoids and semirings. 

* [Teaching Haskell for Understanding](/posts/2017-06-10-zurihac17-talk.mdown) Invited keynote at ZuriHac 2017. As the title suggests, this is focused on how I teach Haskell and relates it to work on teaching mathematics.

* [Applicative Parsing](/posts/2017-01-15-winter-retreat-talk.mdown)  Invited workshop at LambdaConf Winter Retreat 2017. Covers the differences between `Applicative` and `Monad` and works through an example of applicative-style parsing using `optparse-applicative`.
